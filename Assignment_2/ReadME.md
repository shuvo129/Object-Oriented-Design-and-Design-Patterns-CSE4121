This project is designed for pet selling store system. In this project I have defined a pet class.
Then the Bird class and the Animal class were extended from pet class. After that the Parrot class 
and Koel class were extended from Bird class. Again the Dog class and the Cat class were extended 
from Animal class. Finaly the main class is PetStore where we have given the data for a parrot and 
a Cat.
